# Mediaiplus Project
* This project from Mediaiplus Co., Ltd. demonstrates the process of collection of clinical data of South Korea's 46 upper general hospitals to support bio venture companies that are in prepartion for clinical trial. In this project, I collected profiles of all doctors in every department of a hospital with 7 differnt features, including general information, specialty, degree, career, awards, Institute Activity, and the paper. 
* Because each hospital has about at least 200 doctors, I used bs4, requests, and re library in Python to collect and clean data. Then, I also used openpyxl library to insert all cleaned data in excel. 
* All of these data are used later to consolidate customized clinical data based information service platform for bio venture company.
